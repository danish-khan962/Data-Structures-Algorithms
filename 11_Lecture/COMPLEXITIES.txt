/*LECTURE 11*/ Complexities

(1..) TIME COMPLEXITY =>
It is the amount of time taken by an algorithm as a function of length of the input.

Ques.) Why we need time complexity? 
Ans.   For making better programs  and   comparison of algorithm


Complexity notations includes  
Big O notations     Theta 0     Omega 


    * Constant time - O(1)
    * Linear time - O(N)
    * Logarithmic time - O(logN)
    * Quadratic time - o(N^2)
    * Cubic time - O(N^3)


Increase in Time complexity             O(N!)         
                                        O(2^n)        
                                        O(N^3)
                                        O(N^2)
                                        O(NlogN)
                                        O(N)
                                        O(logN)
                                        O(1)


Stuck in TLE (time limit exceeded error): Most of the modern machines can perform 10^8 operation/sec


(2..) SPACE COMPLEXITY =>
Amount of memory taken by a program is defined by space complexity.
It contains fixed +  auxillary space..
